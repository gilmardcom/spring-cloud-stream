This project aims to provide a simple yet complete example of how Spring Cloud Stream can facilitate the communication between microservices.

# Resources

This project is highly inspired by this book: [Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/microservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud-second-edition/9781801072977), published by Packt.

Several items in this codebase are taken fully or with modification from the [book resources](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Microservices-with-Spring-Boot-and-Spring-Cloud-2E).

Diagrams are created based on [C4 model](https://c4model.com) and generated by [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com) and [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org).

### Communication between services via SC-Stream

* User asks a question
* Gateway gets the question and sends to DistributorService
* DistributorService distributes the question to either TimeService or DateService
    * based on the question type
* TimeService or DateService provides the answer
* Gateway sends the answer back to User

**Note:** all the communications are done via Stream 'topics' including: *Question, Answer, TimeQuestion, DateQuestion*
